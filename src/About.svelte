  <span class="fw6"
    >how people use artificial intelligence (AI) to guide their decision-making</span
  >, and use that knowledge to
  <span class="fw6">build better ways to communicate AI predictions</span>. I'm
  particularly interested in high-stakes decision making domains such as
  <span class="fw6">child welfare</span>
  and <span class="fw6">health care</span>, where an understanding of
  algorithms' strengths and limitations is crucial to helping improve people's
  lives.
